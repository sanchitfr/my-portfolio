        <span><p className='about-text'>I am a tech enthusiast and a web developer from Patiala, Punjab with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and a passion for learning new things.
            I have always been fascinated by observable phenomena like physics in my senior education years. After that I developed an interest in
            microprocessors and I was introduced to programming while learning about them in my bachelors. From that I learnt web development and now I create web apps with focus on making good looking, efficient web apps with DRY, 
            reusable and readable code. Ever since  I started coding, I saw the amazing websites people made and published
            and I always wanted to learn the art of making websites. This curiosity pushed me to learn web development, so 
            I picked up some courses and started learning!
